And work hard to stay on top of them: Cloud-native development, SaaS, extensive use of open source, REST APIs, MDM, Datalakes... you name it! For the businesses, they provide rapid low-cost startup allowing them to avoid setting up infrastructure of their own. For developers, these technologies provide "lego build" like rapid prototyping and development capabilities. However it requires the technology personnel to be "jack of all trades" - Developers to be "full stack", "DeveOps conversant" and "Architecturally savvy". For Architects, even more so - not only be conversant, but have hands-on, real life experience in at least some of major parts that make up the enterprise architecture. This leaves a gap between the breadth of experience needed of an architect to device effective solutions and the breadth of in-house architects. For medium sized companies, hiring enterprise architects of this calibre is too expensive or frankly not needed on a full time basis. That is where we come in.',Object(d.jsx)("p",{}),'We have seen time and again, how costs of fixing architectural flaws (we admit, we made some ourselves) grow exponentially as the project progresses.
